# Research Report

## Intro to README.md and mermaid 
### Summary of Work

In order to complete the README.md, I had to research regarding what the proper style behind the file is supposed to look like. To start off, I looked at various README.md examples online to get a grasp of what a common README.md looks like. In addition, I also used the template in the given README.md, and upload the mermaid chunks into an online mermaid live editor to practice utilizing the tool to ensure I would have no syntax errors when completing the file. I also looked over the slide that described the requirements needed for the file, and focused on suverying my teammates to come up with a big picture to use in order to create the file with the right information 

### Motivation

The reason I chose to research about this was because it felt like I was dealing with a lot of ambiguity when trying to start. As I have never completed a proper README.md file before, I wanted to make sure what I was doing was right for both my teammates and the project itself. In other words, I was worried about having the wrong information which would lead to confusion regarding creating our project as well as a possible loss of points for my teammates and I.

### Time Spent

~ *5 minutes* learning about README.md template
~ *10 minutes* looking at online examples of README.md
~ *5 minutes* observing projecture architecture section in README.md examples
~ *10 minutes* using Mermaid Live Editor

### Results

I spent about the first 5 minutes going over the template in the given README.md
 file, and used those bits to search up and understand what was the meaning behi
nd them[^1]. Then, I spent about 10 minutes looking online at different[^3] examples[^4] to get a basic idea of what I was supposed to create[^2]. Once I got a basic idea, I looked over the slide provided for the requirements, and spent the next 5 minutes finding examples that specifically mentioned project architecture to ensure that everything was right[^5]. The last 10 minutes were spent on the mermaid Live Editor to ensure I was using the right syntax and creating the various diagrams, flowcharts, behavior, etc.. properly[^6].
